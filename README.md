# Early Wildfire Smoke & Flame Detection  
Pattern Recognition – Project Part 2 (WS25)

This repository contains the development of an early wildfire detection system.
Based on deep convolutional neural networks and meta-learning based on fusion.
he project focuses on classifying forest fire, smoke, and non-fire images, and Improving robustness by uncertainty-aware decision fusion.

## Project Overview
- Baseline CNN model for 3-class image classification (fire, smoke, non-fire)
- Fusion-based meta-learner combining class probabilities and confidence features
- Analysis of uncertainty to reduce false positives
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices
- Deployment feasibility analysis (model size and inference time)

## Files
- `Untitled2.ipynb`  
  End-to-end Jupyter Notebook including data preprocessing, model training,
  evaluation, and all experiments for Research Questions RQ1–RQ5.

## Dataset
The project uses the Forest Fire, Smoke and Non-Fire Image Dataset from Kaggle.
The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations.

## Figures and Tables
All figures and tables that are to be submitted are included in 
Figures_Tables_SUBMIT.zip via Microsoft Teams submission to complete assignment.

## Submission
This repository is provided for code reference and reproducibility.
The official submission consists of:
- The Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)
- Figures_Tables_SUBMIT.zip
- This GitHub repository link
